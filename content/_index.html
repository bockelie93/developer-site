      We have now started to limit the data in the responses for unauthenticated
      requests: - From 01.11.2020, coordinates and map links have been removed
      from all responses. - From 09.11.2020, only 1 pickup point will be
      returned in the responses for the postal code and location endpoints From
      Monday 11th of January, we will start rate limiting the responses of the
      Pickup Point API. The rate limit (requests per minute) will be lowered
      week by week until the final deadline for authentication - 15th of
      February 2021. After this date, unauthenticated requests will not be
      accepted. We recommend making the
      <a href="api/#authentication">adjustment</a> as
      soon as possible to avoid any problems with your integration setup.
