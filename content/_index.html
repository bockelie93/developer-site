        We have now started to limit the data in the responses for
        unauthenticated requests: - From 01.11.2020, coordinates and map links
        have been removed from all responses. - From 09.11.2020, only 1 pickup
        point will be returned in the responses for the postal code and location
        endpoints From Monday 11th of January, we will start rate limiting the
        responses of the Pickup Point API. The rate limit (requests per minute)
        will be lowered week by week until the final deadline for authentication
        - 15th of February 2021. After this date, unauthenticated requests will
        not be accepted. We recommend making the
        <a href="api/#authentication">adjustment</a> as soon as possible to
        avoid any problems with your integration setup. <br /><br />
