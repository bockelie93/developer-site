<section class="api__section">
  <p>
    Are you running an eCommerce site? Or software dealing with shipments from
    Nordic countries? Then you may want to use Bring APIs.

    If you are new to APIs <em>in general</em>, CodeNewbie has a great

  <h2 id="is-1337-a-valid-postal-code-in-norway">Is 1337 a valid postal code in Norway?</h2>
  <p>
    With this open API, you can check if a number is a valid postal code — and
    look up the related geographic area. Use it to build forms where your user
    enters only a postal code, and the form finds the related city or geographic
    area automatically.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and some additional supported
    countries. For other countries, all postal codes will be marked valid — and
    you can prompt users to enter the city name themselves.

  <p>
    We all know what it’s like waiting for a package to arrive. This open API is
    here to help you show the current status of a shipment. Use it to implement
    tracking on your site or in emails, so that your users can see where their
    stuff is, and when they can expect a delivery. Additional features for
    Mybring customer with authentication.

  <p>
    Bring has lots of different services for shipping stuff. This API looks up
    price and service area, with estimated delivery times. Use it to build forms
    with shipping options, so that your users can choose their preferred
    delivery method on checkout.

  <h2 id="can-we-programatically-book-shipments">Can we programatically book shipments?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes. Yes, you can. It’s pretty neat. You need to be a Mybring customer
    registered for invoice payment. When that is in place, you can integrate
    services from Bring with your systems. Book shipments, get labels, send
    packages on their way. \o/
