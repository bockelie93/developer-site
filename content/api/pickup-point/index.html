  <strong
    >Final deadline for authenticating Pickup Point API requests - 15th of
    February 2021</strong
  >
  <br /><br />
  We have now started to limit the data in the responses for unauthenticated
  requests: - From 01.11.2020, coordinates and map links have been removed from
  all responses. - From 09.11.2020, only 1 pickup point will be returned in the
  responses for the postal code and location endpoints From Monday 11th of
  January, we will start rate limiting the responses of the Pickup Point API.
  The rate limit (requests per minute) will be lowered week by week until the
  final deadline for authentication - 15th of February 2021. After this date,
  unauthenticated requests will not be accepted. We recommend making the
  <a href="/api/pickup-point/#authentication">adjustment</a> as soon as possible
  to avoid any problems with your integration setup. <br /><br />
