  <strong>Important message: </strong>
  <br /><br />
  We are excited to introduce Shipping Guide API 2.0 - a new and improved
  version of our Shipping Guide APIðŸŽŠðŸŽ‰. The latest version is packed with
  powerful capabilities and a simplified, structured request and response model,
  making it easier to provide both you and your end customers with different
  shipping alternatives. Please refer to
  <a href="/api/shipping-guide_2/">Shipping Guide API 2.0</a> for more
  information. <br /><br />
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> The latest version will gradually replace
  <a href="/api/shipping-guide/#soap">existing versions</a> of the Shipping
  Guide API, and versions <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2</strong>,
  <strong>3</strong>, <strong>4</strong>, <strong>5</strong>,
  <strong>6</strong>, <strong>7</strong>, <strong>9</strong> and
  <strong>10</strong> have already been phased out. We are of course giving all
  users enough time to make the switch before phasing out old versions.
