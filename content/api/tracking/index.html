<div class="message--warn maxw48r pam mbl">
  <strong>The Tracking API changes from 01.01.2021 and 01.03.2021</strong>
    <br><br>
      We have done a recent change in Tracking, where if the user have specified the wanted delivery date, then that date is set in the field for the estimated delivery date as well, as there is no point having to set estimation date which is different from the configured wanted delivery date.
    <br><br>
      With reference to the change, the existing field "dateOfEstimatedDelivery" will have the correct information regarding delivery date and therefore, the field "dateOfDelivery" in the open as well as logged in Tracking API versions will be set to Blank from 01.Jan.2021 for backward compatibility and gradually be removed effective from date 01.Mar.2021.
