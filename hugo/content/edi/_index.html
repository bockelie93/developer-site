      EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) in Bring and Posten started in the 90’s.
      EDI Guidelines based on different versions of EDIFACT and API have been
      published since then, IFTMIN S93A, D97A and API. Today’s version is based
      on the D04A standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bring and Posten still support some early versions, however they will not
      be updated with changes. We strongly suggest all our clients to use IFTMIN
      D04A (or API).
