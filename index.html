        <strong>The Pickup Point API became authenticated from 01.11.2020</strong>
        <br><br>
        We have now started to limit the data in the responses for unauthenticated requests:
            
             - From 01.11.2020, coordinates and map links have been removed from all responses. 
             - From 09.11.2020, only 1 pickup point will be returned in the responses for the postal code and location endpoints

        We recommend making the <a href="/api/pickup-point/#steps-for-authentication">adjustment</a> as soon as possible to avoid any problems with your integration setup during peak.
